<h4>Project Configuration</h4>
***The primary focus was on addressing test scenarios involving diverse coding structure requirements. Certain crucial testing scenarios were presumed or overlooked, assuming they could be handled using the current coding structures.***</br></br>


**IDE :** Eclipse </br>
**Framework :** Selenium-TestNG</br>
**Build/Project management tool :** Maven</br>
**Language :** Java</br>
**Design Pattern :** Page Object Model</br>
**Reporting Tool :** Allure</br>
**Error Handling/Logging :** With Try catch and put screenshot code in listener.</br>
**Multi-browser testing and Parallel testing(Currently Commented out) done on :** Chrome & Firefox </br>

**Challenges :** Couldnt solve parallel testing issue - "Tried to run command without establishing a connection", it's a driver close/quit related issue, **still working on it.** </br>

<h4>Improvement/Changes Could have done:</h4>

It would have been possible to relocate all the hardcoded strings to a data properties file or create a separate file specifically for storing strings.</br>
The option of utilizing a parent-child window switch could have been implemented.</br>

<h4>Overview of Covered TestCases:</h4>
